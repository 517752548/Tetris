# Tetris
By Haydn Keung
Created my own version of the all time classic game-Tetris using Unity2D. Most of the code in this project was made with C#. In this game you try and place as many blocks as possible into the container without it overflowing. You can clear rows by completely filling a row with blocks (minos). Please feel free to check out the WebGL version https://haydnkeung.github.io/tetris/index.html. Please note it is not supported for Chrome. It is recommended that you use Microsoft Edge. For the source code please check out https://github.com/haydnkeung/Tetris.
